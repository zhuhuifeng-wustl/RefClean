# RefClean

## Description
This is a tool that can automatically deal with the duplicated reference items in the Letax project.
When writing the proposals/papers in Latex, sometimes we may have multiple bib files in one project. And we may cite the same paper using different names, especially when several people are working on this project.
Under the situation, there may be some duplicated items and some of them are even with different cite names.

## Why I want to write this tool
One time I participated in writing a proposal for NSF. There are five bib files in this project. 
And in the body part, we cited about one hundred references.
At the final step of this proposal, we need to check the references to make sure there are no duplicated items.
